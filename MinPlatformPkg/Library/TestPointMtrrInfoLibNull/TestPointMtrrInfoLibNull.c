TestPointMtrrInfoLibNull.c

An interface for platforms to define the expected MTRR cache types for specific
regions by Ready To Boot.  Create an array of VARIABLE_MTRR_INFO structures for every
MTRR range that you want to validate.  If any of the checked regions don't have the
matching caching type the test will report an error for the failing range and return.
